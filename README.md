# 📄 Anomaly Detection Methods Comparison

This repository contains a short comparative study of three anomaly detection methods presented at CVPR:

- CutPaste (2021)
- PatchCore (2022)
- Prototypical Residual Networks – PRN (2023)

The report analyzes their main ideas, training strategies, memory usage, and reported performance on the MVTec AD dataset.

## Content

- 📄 2-page academic-style report (PDF)
- 📊 Small comparative table of metrics and characteristics

## Context

This study was developed as a project for the Machine Learning course.

The objective was to better understand the conceptual and practical differences between:
- self-supervised approaches (CutPaste),
- unsupervised memory-based methods (PatchCore),
- prototype-based supervised methods (PRN).

## Dataset

All methods are evaluated in their original papers on the MVTec AD dataset.
